## 🚀 Project Overview

Fertilizer selection is crucial for optimal crop yield, but incorrect usage leads to soil degradation and financial loss for farmers. This **AI-powered hybrid model** integrates **Random Forest** and **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to provide **accurate and cost-effective fertilizer recommendations** based on soil and weather conditions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Develop an **AI model** for precise fertilizer recommendations.
- ✅ Combine **Random Forest** (classification) and **ANN** (prediction) for accuracy.
- ✅ Ensure cost-effectiveness for farmers through data-driven optimization.
- ✅ Run the model on **Google Colab** for easy accessibility.

## 🏗️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Publicly available datasets (Kaggle, agricultural research sources).
- Features: **Soil pH, NPK levels, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall**.
- Data Cleaning & Normalization using **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**.

### 2️⃣ **Machine Learning Model**
- **Step 1:** **Random Forest** classifies fertilizer needs into **High, Medium, Low**.
- **Step 2:** **ANN** predicts the exact fertilizer quantity in **kg/acre**.

### 3️⃣ **Optimization Techniques**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid Search & Bayesian Optimization.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying important factors to enhance performance.

### 4️⃣ **Tools & Technologies**
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab 🚀
